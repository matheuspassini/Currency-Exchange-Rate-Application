# Project Title: Currency Exchange Rate Application

## The Currency Exchange Rate Application was created as part of a VBA course on Udemy, named "Basic to Advanced - The Complete Course of Macros and VBA Excel." This Excel-based tool utilizes VBA for web scraping real-time dollar exchange rate data, which is then presented to the user. The application employs UserForm functionality to neatly organize the data within a user-friendly interface.
